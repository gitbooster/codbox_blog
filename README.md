***
Let's start:
* Create a folder for our project, for example «hellper». 
* Open it in the console and run the command:


```
git clone https://github.com/gitbooster/start_hellper.git
```
After:

```
npm install
```

After:

```
bower install
```

To start the server:

```
gulp
```

Plug-ins:

* **[gulp-autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer)** - automatically adds the vendor version prefix to CSS properties (a couple of years ago, I would have killed for such Tools).
* **[gulp-minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-minify)** - is needed for the compression of CSS .
* **[browser-the syn]()** - with the help of this plugin we can easily deploy a local dev server with blackjack and livereload, as well as with its help we can make a tunnel to our localhost, that would be easy to show the layout to the customer .
* **gulp-image-min** - to compress images .
* **imagemin-pngquant** - additions to the previous plug-in to work with PNG .
* **gulp-uglify** - will compress our JS .
* **gulp-less** - to compile our code, less.
* **sourcemaps-gulp** - take to generate css sourscemaps, which will help us in debugging the code .
* **gulp-rigger** - it's just a killer feature. The plugin allows you to import a file into another simple design.
* **gulp-notify** - Send messages to Mac Notification Center, Linux notifications (using notify-send) or Windows >= 8 (using native toaster) or Growl as fallback, using the node-notifier module. Can also specify custom notifier.
